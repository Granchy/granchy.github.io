### Global Chip Supply Chain Background
The global chip supply chain is one that is heavily consolidated. Hardware giants such as Apple, Nvidia, AMD, and many more depend on one single company for their most advanced chip manufacturing needs: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Currently, TSMC manufactures over 60% of the world’s chips, and over 90% of the world’s most advanced chips [1]. The world’s reliance on TSMC poses a significant threat to innovation in AI as global trade relations dictate access to these precious electronics.

### Global Trade Frenzy and U.S.-China Relations
Since the new United-States Administration took office in January 2025, global trade has been in a frenzy. From the Liberation Day tariffs plunging global markets in April to the more recent capture of Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, global trade instability is running rampant and U.S.-China trade relations are strained. With a majority of TSMC’s fabs located in Taiwan making up roughly 90% of the company’s overall manufacturing capacity, this makes TSMC’s production output vulnerable to threats from China, especially considering the U.S. has significant power over policy in Taiwan [2]. 
China is likely looking to retaliate against the U.S. after the U.S. captured Venezuela’s leader and took control of their oil infrastructure. Venezuela currently holds the largest oil reserve in the world, and prior to the U.S.’s capture of Nicolás Maduro, China was receiving 80% of the country’s oil exports [3]. There is a real possibility that China uses Taiwan as a proxy to retaliate against the U.S. given the interconnectedness of both states.

### Implications for Hardware Giants and AI Innovation
If China were to retaliate against the U.S. through threats or attacks on Taiwan, this can thwart the output of the fabs on the island and destabilize the global chip economy. Downstream, this will have impacts on Apple’s supply of iPhones, MacBooks, iPads, and various other products. Similarly, Nvidia’s supply of high-in-demand GPUs used for training AI models such as the A100, H100, B100/B200/GB200, will be shaken, ultimately slowing AI innovation around the globe. The only country who is not likely to be impacted by this is, unsurprisingly, China. China’s reliance on Nvidia is marginal compared to other hardware giants due to controls imposed by the U.S. on Nvidia’s ability to sell to China; this forces China to rely increasingly on domestically designed and produced chips from Huawei, Alibaba, and Baidu.

### Recommendation
In 2014, Apple switched from its competitor Samsung’s foundry to TSMC. Over the next 12 years, Apple and TSMC have built a co-dependence on one another. Currently, Apple is TSMC’s biggest customer at ~20-25% of TSMC’s total revenue and its occupancy of TSMC’s most advanced process nodes (20nm down to 3nm) has often been an overwhelming majority over their tenure together [4]. With security in Apple as an anchor tenant of its fabs, TSMC’s R&D and CapEx spend have grown 8x and 7x, respectively, over their time together enabling TSMC to grow and innovate at a rate it otherwise wouldn’t be able to [4]. This strategy should be used as a blueprint for hardware giants such as AMD and Qualcomm who are not as intertwined with TSMC. In doing so, fab-less hardware designers will minimize the risk that disruptions in Taiwan will have on their supply chain, while benefiting from being a priority as an anchor tenant as well as helping other foundries, potentially local ones, grow and improve.
